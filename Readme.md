# Prompt

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.


For example:

``` ruby

      array = [1,  2,  3,  5,  6,  8,  9] 
```

Returns:

[1,  4,  9,  25,  36,  64,  81]

``` ruby
def sortedSquareArray(array):     

      # Write your code here.

```
